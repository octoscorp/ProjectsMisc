# Miscellaneous Projects
This is somewhere between a working space and a graveyard. Projects which have been enough work to be worthwhile displaying, but not enough to earn their own repository, can live here.

Some projects come here to die, and many will end up being stale. Consider this more a demonstration of my regular work towards improving my own abilities and testing myself. A lot of these projects have very short development lifecycles, so the code quality is substandard compared to my usual work.
